# mle-validate-model-compatibility

## Trigger

Use when the user asks to validate model compatibility, requests the stated deliverable, or supplies an artifact that requires this atomic workflow. Do not select by job title alone.

## Contract

- Profile: `advisory-analysis`
- Risk tier: `R0-light`
- Execution path: `fast-path`
- Contract version: `3.0`
- Criticality: `deep`
- Goal: kiểm tra schema, runtime, feature và consumer compatibility.
- Primary deliverable: **compatibility report**.

## Inputs and readiness

- Confirm objective, consumer, owner, target/environment, scope, constraints and acceptance criteria.
- Identify relevant systems, data, artifacts, dependencies, authority, evidence and tests.
- For controlled work, establish containment, backup, rollback or recovery before execution.

If an absent input changes semantics, risk, cost, scope or acceptance, classify it as blocking. Otherwise state a bounded assumption and record it.

## Deep execution contract

- Contract version: `3.0`.
- Criticality: `deep`; treat this as a low-freedom protocol for **compatibility report**.

Mandatory domain inputs:
- Validated model/artifact.
- Feature and inference contracts.
- Latency/throughput/fallback requirements.

Invariants that must remain true:
- Training-serving parity is tested.
- Artifacts are immutable.
- Failure degrades safely.

Decision and execution sequence:
1. Package.
2. Build feature/inference path.
3. Test compatibility/load/failure.
4. Stage shadow/canary.
5. Hand off operations.

Required proof:
- Artifact digest.
- Contract/skew tests.
- Load/fallback results and integration release record.

Block before mutation or a positive completion decision when a mandatory input, authority, invariant, recovery path or proof source is unresolved. Preserve the failed state and route remediation explicitly; never weaken a test or threshold merely to pass.


## Procedure

1. Read [the lifecycle standard](../lifecycle-standard.md); apply its stages, gates and risk-adaptive path.
2. Load only applicable company context, then inspect live artifacts when facts may have changed.
3. Load technology or industry references only when they affect this deliverable.
4. Execute the stated goal; keep one primary deliverable and record provenance for material facts.
5. Run the tests below, resolve failures, obtain required approval and complete the lifecycle handoff.

Additional resources:
- None beyond the selected company, technology and industry context.


## Tests and evidence

- Independent calculation or alternate method.
- Assumption and sensitivity challenge.
- Domain-semantic review.

Also verify scope and acceptance criteria, test relevant edge/failure paths, store evidence and keep failed mandatory checks visible. Use independent critical acceptance testing when practical.

## Approval and done

Explicit approval is normally not required for read-only work, but becomes mandatory if scope expands to a governed or mutating action. Approval is version- and scope-specific and never waives testing. Finish only when the deliverable meets acceptance criteria, mandatory tests pass, required approval exists, residual risks have owners, and handoff/monitoring is explicit. Stop as `blocked` or `failed` on missing authority, material ambiguity, failed validation or unsafe recovery; never fabricate success.

## Return

Return the task ID, lifecycle profile, risk tier, execution path, phase reached, primary deliverable, evidence links, test results, approvals, assumptions, open risks, affected assets, owner and one explicit next task. Route cross-role work through the department orchestrator.
