# academy-outline-lesson-from-source

## Trigger

Use when the user asks to outline lesson from source, requests the stated deliverable, or supplies an artifact that requires this atomic workflow. Do not select by job title alone.

## Contract

- Profile: `learning`
- Risk tier: `R1-reviewed`
- Execution path: `standard-path`
- Contract version: `3.0`
- Criticality: `standard`
- Model tier: `standard` per [model selection](../model-selection.md); a lighter model never lowers the bar this output must clear.
- Goal: biến một tài liệu nguồn thành dàn bài buổi học có nhịp được gõ kiểu, mỗi nhịp truy được về đoạn cụ thể trong nguồn và ghi rõ phần nguồn không được dùng.
- Primary deliverable: **source-traced lesson outline**.

## Inputs and readiness

- Confirm objective, consumer, owner, target/environment, scope, constraints and acceptance criteria.
- Identify relevant systems, data, artifacts, dependencies, authority, evidence and tests.
- For controlled work, establish containment, backup, rollback or recovery before execution.

If an absent input changes semantics, risk, cost, scope or acceptance, classify it as blocking. Otherwise state a bounded assumption and record it.


## Procedure

1. Read [the lifecycle standard](../lifecycle-standard.md); apply its stages, gates and risk-adaptive path.
2. Load only applicable company context, then inspect live artifacts when facts may have changed.
3. Load technology or industry references only when they affect this deliverable.
4. Execute the stated goal; keep one primary deliverable and record provenance for material facts.
5. Run the tests below, resolve failures, obtain required approval and complete the lifecycle handoff.

Additional resources:
- Read [role curricula](../role-curricula.md) and [assessment rules](../assessment-and-certification.md).
- Reuse the applicable curriculum, lesson, assessment or evidence template from `../../assets/`.
- Read [the lesson scene standard](../lesson-scene-standard.md). The outline comes first and is only an outline: ordered beats, each with a type, the claim it teaches, and the span of the source it rests on. Nothing is drafted until that list is settled, because noticing four beats on setup and none on the failure mode is cheapest before any of them exists.
- Every beat names its source span precisely enough that a second person opens the file and lands on the same passage. A beat with no span teaches something the source does not say — it may still be correct, and it stays marked unsourced rather than left to look sourced.
- End the outline with the spans nobody used. Material a lesson skips is a decision, and an undocumented decision cannot be told apart from an oversight. Duration figures are estimates until somebody has run the session, and they are labelled as estimates.

- Certification proves only the named, versioned competencies demonstrated by evidence; it never proves tenure, job title, automatic promotion or general seniority.
- Upgrade to R3-controlled and require People/HR plus accountable business approval when certification affects employment, promotion, compensation, regulation or external claims.
- For a curriculum bundle, select one primary artifact and chain `academy-write-theory-lesson` → `academy-design-hands-on-lab` → `academy-design-summative-exam` → `academy-write-answer-key` → `academy-write-assessment-rubric` → `academy-calibrate-assessors` → `academy-certify-role-competency` → `academy-measure-training-effectiveness` as applicable.

## Tests and evidence

- Authoritative-source and domain-review verification.
- Prerequisite, graph-cycle, misconception and coverage checks.
- Novel-scenario application and learning-transfer test.

Also verify scope and acceptance criteria, test relevant edge/failure paths, store evidence and keep failed mandatory checks visible. Use independent critical acceptance testing when practical.

## Approval and done

Require named reviewer acceptance before the artifact becomes an organizational baseline. Approval is version- and scope-specific and never waives testing. Finish only when the deliverable meets acceptance criteria, mandatory tests pass, required approval exists, residual risks have owners, and handoff/monitoring is explicit. Stop as `blocked` or `failed` on missing authority, material ambiguity, failed validation or unsafe recovery; never fabricate success.

## Return

Return the task ID, lifecycle profile, risk tier, execution path, phase reached, primary deliverable, evidence links, test results, approvals, assumptions, open risks, affected assets, owner and one explicit next task. Route cross-role work through the department orchestrator.

Report it in the compact shape from [response compression](../response-compression.md): one state line, the deliverable, only the fields that carry content, then one next action. Blocked gates, unrun checks, assumptions, limitations and residual risks are printed in full even here.
