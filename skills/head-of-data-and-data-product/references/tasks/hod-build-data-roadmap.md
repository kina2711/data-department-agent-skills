# hod-build-data-roadmap

## Trigger

Use when the user asks to build data roadmap, requests the stated deliverable, or supplies an artifact that requires this atomic workflow. Do not select by job title alone.

## Contract

- Profile: `build-change`
- Risk tier: `R2-standard`
- Execution path: `standard-path`
- Contract version: `3.0`
- Criticality: `deep`
- Model tier: `standard` per [model selection](../model-selection.md); a lighter model never lowers the bar this output must clear.
- Goal: sắp xếp initiative theo value, risk và dependency.
- Primary deliverable: **phased roadmap**.

## Inputs and readiness

- Confirm objective, consumer, owner, target/environment, scope, constraints and acceptance criteria.
- Identify relevant systems, data, artifacts, dependencies, authority, evidence and tests.
- For controlled work, establish containment, backup, rollback or recovery before execution.

If an absent input changes semantics, risk, cost, scope or acceptance, classify it as blocking. Otherwise state a bounded assumption and record it.

## Deep execution contract

- Contract version: `3.0`.
- Criticality: `deep`; treat this as a low-freedom protocol for **phased roadmap**.

Mandatory domain inputs:
- Business outcomes and decision owners.
- Portfolio capacity and constraints.
- Adoption/value baseline.

Invariants that must remain true:
- Priorities trace to outcomes.
- Estimates expose uncertainty.
- Implementation ownership is handed off.

Decision and execution sequence:
1. Frame outcome.
2. Compare options.
3. Prioritize with capacity.
4. Define benefit and adoption evidence.
5. Govern review.

Required proof:
- Decision log.
- Portfolio trade-offs.
- Value/adoption measures and accountable acceptance.

Block before mutation or a positive completion decision when a mandatory input, authority, invariant, recovery path or proof source is unresolved. Preserve the failed state and route remediation explicitly; never weaken a test or threshold merely to pass.


## Procedure

1. Read [the lifecycle standard](../lifecycle-standard.md); apply its stages, gates and risk-adaptive path.
2. Load only applicable company context, then inspect live artifacts when facts may have changed.
3. Load technology or industry references only when they affect this deliverable.
4. Execute the stated goal; keep one primary deliverable and record provenance for material facts.
5. Run the tests below, resolve failures, obtain required approval and complete the lifecycle handoff.

Additional resources:
- Score options with `../../scripts/score_portfolio_options.py`; hard gates remove an initiative from the ranking instead of being traded off inside the arithmetic, and rank differences inside the tie threshold are reported as indistinguishable.
- Read [the execution discipline standard](../execution-discipline-standard.md).
- Before Git-backed mutation, require a verified success contract and pre-change scope contract. After the final change, run `core-audit-change-scope` and `core-verify-deliverable`; release remains blocked if either control is absent or failed.


## Tests and evidence

- Static/unit/contract tests.
- Integration and data reconciliation.
- Security/performance/regression checks.

Also verify scope and acceptance criteria, test relevant edge/failure paths, store evidence and keep failed mandatory checks visible. Use independent critical acceptance testing when practical.

## Approval and done

Require owner approval before production, sensitive, externally visible or materially costly execution. Approval is version- and scope-specific and never waives testing. Finish only when the deliverable meets acceptance criteria, mandatory tests pass, required approval exists, residual risks have owners, and handoff/monitoring is explicit. Stop as `blocked` or `failed` on missing authority, material ambiguity, failed validation or unsafe recovery; never fabricate success.

## Return

Return the task ID, lifecycle profile, risk tier, execution path, phase reached, primary deliverable, evidence links, test results, approvals, assumptions, open risks, affected assets, owner and one explicit next task. Route cross-role work through the department orchestrator.

Return the full contract; [response compression](../response-compression.md) governs wording, never coverage. Never soften `blocked` or `failed`, and never report an unrun check as a pass.

Mirror the outcome into `../../assets/atomic-task-output.yaml` alongside the prose. Where the prose and the structured record disagree, the record stands and the task is not complete.
